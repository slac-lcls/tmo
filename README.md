# tmo
Data analysis tools for the TMO instrument.
## Quick start
The tmo repo hosts software tools for online and offline data analysis of [TMO](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/instruments/neh-1-1) experiments. These tools are facilited by the [LCLS-II software](https://github.com/slac-lcls/lcls2), especially its psana libray,  which is used to acquire and access the LCLS data, as well as to assist data analysis with the algorithms. First-time psana users are recommended to go through 
[this confluence page](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LCLSIIData/psana) before using or contributing to the tmo scripts. 

The repo is structured into three spaces - [ana](https://github.com/slac-lcls/tmo/tree/main/ana) for both general and instrument-specific scripts, [mon](https://github.com/slac-lcls/tmo/tree/main/mon) for online data analysis and [utils](https://github.com/slac-lcls/tmo/tree/main/utils) for handy library functions.(to be continued...)
